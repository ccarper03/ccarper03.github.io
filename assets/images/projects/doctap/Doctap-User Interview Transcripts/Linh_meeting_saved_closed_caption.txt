Gotcha. That's awesome. Are you, all doing it on, is it like an online thing where you, interact through like a platform like Slack.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:01:02
Yeah, so we do have a Slack channel. So that's where a lot of our communication is and then like all our classes are live like their zoom.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:01:11
And like they'll share their screen and we can kinda walk through like some, they've prepared the class structure like in Figma or they jam and they kinda walk through their screens and that would kind of all follow along.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:01:25
In there live. So that's pretty cool.

[Linh Ly] 09:01:28
Actually, that looks really nice. I feel like I would prefer that over like what my boot camp offers actually.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:01:30
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:01:36
Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:01:36
So. Yeah, ours is more of like a, format where the readings are like, it's a bunch of readings and it's all online.

[Linh Ly] 09:01:46
So like the majority of our learning has mostly been like reading through, like articles or like reading through like.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:01:51
Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:01:54
It's like structure. I guess like yeah, that they give us.

Cool. Alright, and then we can always grab them from the recording.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:03:11
So yeah, we're recording this and we'll have transcripts on. So that we can save that and that way we can synthesize the data after this.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:03:24
Alright, I'm gonna go and jump in.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:03:27
Start, so I'm just to that reporting now.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:03:31
Alright, so I'm not sure how much information Chuck gave you already. But just you know, there's no pressure here.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:03:39
There's no right or wrong answers. It's just an open and honest conversation. I am reading questions off a script.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:03:47
So if you kind of notice that I'm looking down or, you know, reading off of something, that's why.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:03:51
We're just kinda here to get your hearing about your experiences, thoughts and suggestions regarding booking doctors appointments online.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:04:04

[Shelby Matthews] 09:04:15
Alright. Yeah, yeah, so like if you've never had an experience booking doctor's equipment online, that's okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:04:23
We could just kind of talk about. Just booking any kind of appointment online. Maybe you've had to book.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:04:29
Massage therapy appointment, a chiropractor appointment, just anything and even if it's not medical related that all kind of help us.

[Linh Ly] 09:04:38
Hmm.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:04:38
Kinda understand how to improve online booking. Okay. So, alright, so we'll start with some background questions.

[Linh Ly] 09:04:42
Yeah, sounds good.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:04:47
Do you mind sharing where you're located?

[Shelby Matthews] 09:05:16
Gotcha. Okay, awesome. Yeah, that's perfect. Thank you.

[Linh Ly] 09:05:17
If the answer is your question.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:05:20
Alright, now I'm just gonna kinda jump into. The regular questions relevant to online booking. Okay, so do you typically prefer having an in person doctors appointment or would you prefer to have an online doctor's appointment?

[Linh Ly] 09:05:36
Yeah, so like the process of booking the appointment.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:05:41
I'm just like if you had the option, would you prefer to visit your doctor in person or online?

[Linh Ly] 09:05:47
Oh, Okay, so just like talking to my doctor.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:05:47
If you had your preference. Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't, yeah, for any various reason, I guess.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:05:56
Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:05:56
Yeah, so I like rather Talk to my doctor in person. Like anything medical related. I definitely feel more comfortable in person.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:06:02
Okay.

[Linh Ly] 09:06:08
I think it's just cause I've always been so used to, the fact of like going into an office and like, like talking to the person who like knows.

[Linh Ly] 09:06:19
A lot of like about the yeah like medical stuff like in person so it's just more familiar to me.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:06:21
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:06:26
Understood. Okay, great. Alright, do you mind if you have a recent experience of booking a doctor's appointment online?

[Shelby Matthews] 09:06:36
Do you mind sharing that with us?

[Linh Ly] 09:06:38
Yeah, so I Can't really remember recent like doctor's appointment. Sorry. I do, I have booked an appointment recently for a for the dentists and also for.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:06:44
That's okay. You're okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:06:53
That's fine.

[Linh Ly] 09:06:56
Yeah, just like with some teeth like surgery. But it was all done in person.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:07:02
Okay.

[Linh Ly] 09:07:03
So, or through the phone. So I, yeah, I just called up my dentist's office and then asked them if they have an appointment, available soon.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:07:15
Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:07:15
And They gave me like the date and times and checked my Google calendars because that's where I usually put a lot of my events and stuff.

[Linh Ly] 09:07:25
And yeah, just. Try to see if like any of the dates that they gave me worked out And yeah, it was pretty, it was a pretty like, like non painful flow.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:07:32
Gotcha.

[Linh Ly] 09:07:39
I think it's, I think For me, I don't mind calling the office to get stuff done.

[Linh Ly] 09:07:45
So, I mean, it's not like my most preferred choice. But like, I also don't mind it.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:07:48
Gotcha.

[Linh Ly] 09:07:50
And it gets things done like fairly quick. So, and there's a like a person on the other end that I can like talk to and like.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:07:53
Thank you.

[Linh Ly] 09:07:59
Ask questions that I needed. So, yeah, so the previous, most recent dentist appointment was made through the phone.

[Linh Ly] 09:08:09
And, but I have made like that appointments. For my pet and that was through an app.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:08:13
Hmm, okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:08:16
Okay, do you mind just out of curiosity? Do you kind of mind walking through how that looks?

[Linh Ly] 09:08:18
Hmm.

[Linh Ly] 09:08:22
Yeah, sure. So, I is okay if I take my phone or like. Both through my phone and like let you know too because Awesome.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:08:27
Yeah, yeah, you're, yeah, you're good. Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:08:32
Alright, so, I use this app called Pet Desk and I think that's like the main app that my that our vet uses for every, every customer.

[Linh Ly] 09:08:43
And I. So it's a very like straightforward app like you make a profile for your pet.

[Linh Ly] 09:08:51
And once you make it, like I can also just like show you like. It's, so that's my pet and then, they have like the navigations at the bottom where you, like they have your profile, providers to do's and appointments and if you want to make an appointment.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:08:56
Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:09:13
You just I guess. Well, I don't really use it too often actually, but I guess like there would be like okay so like you go under providers and you would just requests like it appointment through there and it's pretty straightforward like they ask why like the reason for it and then they'll provide like a list of things which I really appreciate cause sometimes I'm not really sure what to put in those areas.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:09:19
It's okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:09:29
Gotcha.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:09:47
Gotcha.

[Linh Ly] 09:09:47
Any notes in special requests? And then a phone number. And then you just submit 3 costs and I think the next screen is like to provide a date and time.

[Linh Ly] 09:09:59
And most like often like our most of the time they'll like, use that date and time, like they'll be able to accommodate that.

[Linh Ly] 09:10:09
So. Yeah, it.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:10:09
Gotcha. That sounds nice. And so Do you get to access like your record, the your pets records from the app?

[Shelby Matthews] 09:10:19
Like any like shot records or does it keep any like help general health information within there that you could see or does it ask for anything like that?

[Linh Ly] 09:10:26
Oh yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:10:30
So I've Think? Yeah, for as for like general records, I don't think it's on here.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:10:39
Okay.

[Linh Ly] 09:10:40
Usually when we want, oh wait, actually. So it tells us a list of his medical records, but I think we.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:10:51
You still gotta get those from person. Yes.

[Linh Ly] 09:10:52
We, yeah, I think we. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, either that or through email.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:10:58
Yeah, well, alright, just curious, like if. I'm imagine it still saves time every time you wanna go book your next appointment.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:11:06
So that's nice. Okay, so. If you could imagine like your ideal online booking experience.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:11:18
What features or services do you kinda wish you'd see that a platform would offer you?

[Linh Ly] 09:11:25
Yeah, so that's a good question, I think. Since whenever I book appointments, usually if it's medical, like my intention is to go into it.

[Linh Ly] 09:11:39
Not wasting any time, cause I think of it more as like a chore, like. Or task that I just need to do and I always end up, it's one of those tasks where I always end up putting it aside because it's so troublesome.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:11:41
Okay.

[Linh Ly] 09:11:53
So I think my ideal experience like over to just sum it up would be efficient like to like time efficient.

[Linh Ly] 09:12:02
I don't wanna spend more than like 5 min to, schedule my appointment because by then I think I'll get like super irritated.

[Linh Ly] 09:12:11
And so, and like end up dropping it and like trying it a different time. So like a process where it doesn't require a lot of like signing up.

[Linh Ly] 09:12:21
Or like in putting a lot of information. I know that there are times for like if you're a new patient, you'll have to like fill out forms and stuff.

[Linh Ly] 09:12:28
So, I guess Yeah, I don't know. I feel like that process I like.

[Linh Ly] 09:12:34
I think it's like a mandatory process, so I don't know if like you can get away with like making that process shorter or like more efficient, but, I don't know, having like some sort of automation tool that likes a lot of stuff for you.

[Linh Ly] 09:12:47
I don't know, I'm just like. Like going off of like really like for fetch ideas right now, but.

[Linh Ly] 09:12:53
Yeah, I feel like like very like short would be like my ideal like process and also.

[Linh Ly] 09:13:02
Like, I don't know, I feel like all of my experiences so far, even though like they haven't been like online booking.

[Linh Ly] 09:13:12
It's like I've been able to get the dates and times that I wanted. For my appointments.

[Linh Ly] 09:13:20
So, China. Think like in terms of like a platform. I feel like having a nice UI.

[Linh Ly] 09:13:28
That isn't confusing or like, very like. Plain and straightforward like like maybe a calendar would be really nice.

[Linh Ly] 09:13:37
Because I use Google calendars a lot and just to have that familiarity of like, and also like that ease of like booking an appointment.

[Linh Ly] 09:13:47
Through like a calendar is She was just very nice to me. Like it's like a nice to have like feature.

[Linh Ly] 09:13:57
Like in my opinion. So, having something like visual, And yeah, just like very like.

[Linh Ly] 09:14:10
Sorry, I don't know like what the word is, but just like very like, yeah, something very visual and very like type of efficient.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:14:16
Yeah, makes perfect sense. Awesome. So, so maybe as a new patient. You would understand it.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:14:25
Like you would maybe provide, you'd be okay with providing your Need to feel safe providing your medical history online.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:14:33
Or do you think you'd prefer to do that step in person?

[Linh Ly] 09:14:37
Yeah, so I am. Not too pressed on like mental history, like it's just like.

[Linh Ly] 09:14:45
I don't know, like, I don't really have that feeling of like, oh, like, I'm, someone's gonna look at like my records and like know my blood pressure or something like I don't know like what big deal is but I mean I still understand like that wall of privacy, like it's my stuff.

[Linh Ly] 09:15:04
Like, I don't know if I want people to look at it. So I would say that, Like in terms of like, giving away my medical records to like my next like like dentist or doctor's place.

[Linh Ly] 09:15:16
It would be nice to have some sort of system where like they can do it like on the back end to transfer it themselves.

[Linh Ly] 09:15:24
Like, like For example, my old doctor's place. Transferring it Like, yeah, transferring that information to the new doctor's place in a more seamless way, because I have run into instances where I had to like email other people.

[Linh Ly] 09:15:42
To let them to get like my medical records. And like email the new place and be like okay here the medical records are like they'll or I'll let them know that they'll be emailing the medical records so like a better like like better streamlining between those 2 doctors places would be nice or just having like an option to click a button and be like, oh, I, we've like sent a request to like your

[Linh Ly] 09:16:08
old doctor's place. You'll be getting updates on like how the process of like your medical records are being handled.

[Linh Ly] 09:16:15
That would be nice.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:16:15
Yeah, Okay, so you mentioned. That you like. Having Google calendars, to schedule your appointments.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:16:28
How do you remember your appointments other than that? You're just good about checking your calendar or is there another method that might help you remember your appointment?

[Shelby Matthews] 09:16:38
That you Okay.

[Linh Ly] 09:16:38
Yeah, so, oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah, so it's mostly Google Calendars.

[Linh Ly] 09:16:46
Just because I have like everything on there. So like all of my like through camp work. Like, or assignments or like meetings.

[Linh Ly] 09:16:54
I have like a lot of like my personal stuff on there too, like if I'm meeting a friend, I put that on the calendar.

[Linh Ly] 09:17:00
So it's like my main method of like. Scheduling my life. So I look at it pretty frequently, like almost every day.

[Linh Ly] 09:17:09
But other than Google Calendar, I do have like this test like. App on my phone.

[Linh Ly] 09:17:14
I use an Android. So I don't use like Apple reminders or anything, even though I have a MacBook.

[Linh Ly] 09:17:21
But since like my phone is like my main go to like, but since like my phone is like my main go to like I take my phone everywhere I use that app and I'll like, write down the stuff that I need to do.

[Linh Ly] 09:17:31
And like it's not for like a Like I wouldn't say that. Oh, I have a doctor's appointment at like Thursday at 2 30 pm but it's more so for like oh I need to like call the oral surgeons office to make sure that they have like my x-rays.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:17:45
Hmm. Gotcha.

[Linh Ly] 09:17:49
So that's something that I use that's like the my related to doctors appointments or depths appointments but I think it's mostly Google Calendar or like if it was like.

[Linh Ly] 09:18:01
If I'm really like having doubts about my memory, like I'll like put sticking notes everywhere on my table, to like kind of like.

[Linh Ly] 09:18:09
Tell myself like you have an appointment you need to go.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:18:12
Good, good points there. Also, so have you ever experienced like maybe your Dennis appointment?

[Shelby Matthews] 09:18:20
How did they remind you? Like did they follow up at all before your appointment? Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:18:24
Oh yeah, now that you mentioned it, yeah, they do call me. They, they'll either call me and if I, they can't get to me on the phone, they'll, leave a voicemail or Text me.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:18:38
Okay.

[Linh Ly] 09:18:39
So I actually do appreciate that though because yeah it just gives me an extra layer of like reminders which I appreciate more than not getting any so that's something that I do like.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:18:45
Right.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:18:52
Awesome, cool. Let's see. What about, when you show up to your appointment?

[Shelby Matthews] 09:19:04
I guess you're probably checking in in person. And then you. Do you experience long wait times once you checked in typically?

[Linh Ly] 09:19:14
Yeah, some, I think it depends on the place actually. So I think. From what I can remember.

[Linh Ly] 09:19:25
If there are places, so I think I've been to a couple of places where I just like, oh, tiny bit late, like it like maybe like 5 min or something.

[Linh Ly] 09:19:38
And for some reason I end up waiting longer than if I go to a place, a different place early.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:19:44
Okay.

[Linh Ly] 09:19:44
Or actually Not the place, but like I guess like the timing of it all. So like, if I go to a place early, I will like.

[Linh Ly] 09:19:53
Like they'll usually like take me in pretty early too. So I think it depends on like.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:19:57
Gotcha.

[Linh Ly] 09:20:01
Sorry, not the place, but like how they do like the timing of everything. So I would say.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:20:04
Yeah. Right.

[Linh Ly] 09:20:10
Yeah, it depends on like how early you get there. How late you get there.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:20:15
Gotcha. And so, I'm trying to figure out how to ask.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:20:21
Where I'm getting at. Basically.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:20:25
Oh, this is the tricky part for me. I don't wanna like lead you into something.

[Linh Ly] 09:20:28
Oh yeah, you're good. Yeah, feel free. Take your time.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:20:30
So just remember, yeah, yeah, so I'm like, Is there any way that like you could think of that might make that?

[Shelby Matthews] 09:20:38
Check in process smoother for you. And your schedule. I mean, if you don't know, it's okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:20:44
I'm just curious.

[Linh Ly] 09:20:46
Oh yeah, I think. No, that's a good question. I actually thought of something like right now.

[Linh Ly] 09:20:52
Having like a queue system. So like, I know. Like I guess like most offices or.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:20:54
Okay.

[Linh Ly] 09:21:00
Like pretty much old school world where they'll be like oh if you sit here then you're the nurse is gonna come out and like I don't know, like sometimes they don't even say how long it's gonna be.

[Linh Ly] 09:21:12
But having like some sort of screen at the office that puts your name on there and like tells you how many minutes it's gonna be until someone's gonna come out and get you, that would be really useful.

[Linh Ly] 09:21:26
I would say, I actually, yeah, I guess it would be, I would say that it would make the experience smoother just cause, you know, people going to the dentists or the doctors.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:21:32
Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:21:35
They are on a, either on a time crunch or they made time out of their day to get to this appointment and could possibly be having like.

[Linh Ly] 09:21:44
Other tasker errands that they have to, run to afterwards. So, just knowing.

[Linh Ly] 09:21:50
Like how long it's gonna be until. You know, or just having a good gauge of like how, much longer they have to wait and like how much longer it is for their appointment to end, I think would be really useful, for someone.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:22:05
Yeah, sure. Makes sense. Okay, I think I've got one more question. Alright, so let's say you need a book on appointment and you have a list of doctors to choose from.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:22:18
What influences your decision? See you select.

[Linh Ly] 09:22:23
Yeah, yeah, so. If I had a list of doctors, so I think me being a very like get to the, like just get get to the end type of person really quick.

[Linh Ly] 09:22:36
Actually, It's I don't know if it's bad or not, but I actually just like choose whatever doctor is available.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:22:43
Makes sense.

[Linh Ly] 09:22:43
But something that I do before is if they're female, like I just feel more comfortable if it's a female doctor.

[Linh Ly] 09:22:51
For like, Mostly like physical body stuff, but like if it's like a. Male dentists then it's fine.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:22:53
Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:22:59
But yeah, female doctors. If I like had to think more about it, maybe like the years of experience, like it doesn't have to like, it's not like a big factor to me, like the years of experience.

[Linh Ly] 09:23:13
Like it doesn't have to like, it's not like a big factor to me, but like it's one of those things that.

[Linh Ly] 09:23:14
You know, you can kinda just think about when you're like choosing things or like subconsciously think about, for me at least.

[Linh Ly] 09:23:21
So, Yeah, that and like. Yeah, I don't think there's like much that's on my checklist.

[Linh Ly] 09:23:29
Maybe because I don't really like I think I'm relatively healthy. Like I don't have to like go to the doctors for any like.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:23:35
Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:23:37
Hey, like anything like that. So, and I'm also not very like I jump around a lot like so I don't really have like a primary doctor that I would go to or like someone that I'm like very like.

[Linh Ly] 09:23:50
Familiar with so it's usually a matter of like finding someone who's available. I think it would be nice to like see their face maybe when you're at that stage of like trying to choose like a doctor or someone, just because I like to put a name to a face and I guess like They're like, I don't know, it just feels nicer just knowing who I'm gonna

[Linh Ly] 09:24:18
be talking to. So yeah, I think, yeah, hopefully that gives you something. I'm sorry if I don't like, like your target audience.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:24:24
No, you're again. No, you're actually doing really good. Yeah, this is perfect actually.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:24:32
Yeah, I think we got, covered everything. Let's see here. Well, yep, I think that's good.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:24:40
Okay, so we appreciate you for taking this time with us. Is there anything else that you can think of you might wanna add or do you have any questions?

[Linh Ly] 09:24:52
I don't think so. I do have a question though, so it's this platform you're trying to build out?

[Shelby Matthews] 09:25:00
Hmm.

[Linh Ly] 09:25:00
Is it going to be like a web-based application or just like an app?

[Shelby Matthews] 09:25:03
Yeah, so this is a web-based application. It's called. And it's actually only available in the UK.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:25:13
So that's kind of been a little bit of a challenge for us, like trying to think of that difference because most of the people we're interviewing are in the US.

[Linh Ly] 09:25:16
Oh.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:25:21
But we did get actually at least one person in the UK, so that was helpful. So yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:25:25
Oh, that's awesome.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:25:26
Yeah. Yeah, so yeah, it's gonna. It could be interesting, but.

[Linh Ly] 09:25:31
Oh, that's so cool. How did you like stumble upon like? The yeah the app or the or get like get in contact with like the people who run the application.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:25:43
The Doc-tap app. So we don't have access to any of that. We just have.

[Linh Ly] 09:25:44
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:25:49
We're doing these, initial interviews. And then based on the data we get.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:25:56
From these interviews, we're going to improve it. And I don't believe that any point along the way that we're actually talking to.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:26:04
Anyone from dot dot tap and people around this. Yeah. So it's just kind of like a.

[Linh Ly] 09:26:07
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:26:10
The theoretical situation here going through the process of how we would improve it. And then testing that. With kinda like people like you like again we're gonna run through testing through a platform called and we'll see, see if we've improved.

[Linh Ly] 09:26:25
Oh yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:26:28
Thanks, and then, we'll kind of use those metrics just to put in our portfolio and then, we'll kind of use those metrics just to put in our portfolio and then.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:26:34
We'll put like our key findings and keep learning since say this is what we do get next based on.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:26:41
Our usability tests. So. Yeah, yeah, so it would be cool if we actually got to talk to actual dock tap or people from.

[Linh Ly] 09:26:43
Gotcha. Okay. Cool.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:26:51
The platform but I guess that's just not how this case studies set up.

[Linh Ly] 09:26:55
Gotcha. Okay, well I think you did a pretty good job like asking the questions too. Those are some really like good like like the flow of it was really nice.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:26:59
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:27:02
Yeah. Yeah, that's good. It's been the trick is following a script, but then also making sure we're not following a script but then also making sure we're not following it too closely and just make it conversational and relevant to each individual.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:27:14
So it gets challenging. Okay. Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:27:14
Oh yeah. Oh my gosh, yeah. I do struggle with it too. And also like it just reminded me to like, take screenshots of like my interviews too, so.

[Linh Ly] 09:27:25
Thanks for that.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:27:25
Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, well reach out, you know, we're happy to, you know, answer your questions, talk about UX, like Chuck's really good about giving advice and stuff too.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:27:54
So. Yeah.

[Linh Ly] 09:27:59
Alright.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:27:59
Yeah, that's kind of the probably the big one. I'm just not sure if I want to work for Walmart, but it would definitely be a good option.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:28:07
I used to always just picture myself working for a smaller businesses. I don't know why that's just what I'm used to.

[Shelby Matthews] 09:28:12
But I'm open to figuring out whatever happens out of. After this so we'll see.

[Linh Ly] 09:28:13
You know.

[Linh Ly] 09:28:18
