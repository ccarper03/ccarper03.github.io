[Deanie Deitterick] 13:01:12

But we may wanna take like a screenshot like picture. So we can put that on our board.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:01:22
Are you okay with that as well? Like just, okay, just making sure. Alright. Well, we're gonna start with some background questions.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:01:23
Yes. Right.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:01:32
Where are you located?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:01:34
I'm located in Kerry, North Carolina.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:01:37
Alright, so would you say you would prefer to visit a doctor in person or would you prefer to visit one online for your medical Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:01:49
Of course that depends on what. Good visits for. So I'm comfortable with both.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:01:54
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:01:56
Alright, so, yeah, it depends kind of on. What's going on with you, you'd say, like the severity.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:02:02
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:02:04
Of the situation. Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:02:06
Correct. Or whether I'm comfortable.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:02:11
Yeah.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:02:11
With the particular illness or concern I have.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:02:16
I gotcha. Okay. Let's see here. Do you mind telling us your age?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:02:23
I'm 74. No, I'm 75 now. Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:02:26
Okay. Alright. And I think Charles already said you retired, is that correct?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:02:34
Yes, I'm retired.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:02:36
Okay. Do you mind sharing? We're gonna go right into the actual questions related to looking at doctors appointment now.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:02:45
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:02:45
Do you have a recent experience of booking a doctor's appointment online that you could share with us?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:02:53
Yes, actually I use, The Duke My Chart. And the VA system for my husband.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:02:57
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:03:01
I'm his caregiver.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:03:02
Okay. Do, would you have a chance to kinda walk us through what that process of booking?

[Shelby Matthews] 13:03:11
An appointment looks like maybe from start to finish either of those options, you know.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:03:15
Okay. When I when I want to see my doctor, I usually go into my chart. And I tell her what my issue is and ask her advice on whether.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:03:28
She needs to see me or whether it's just something we can talk about either. As a phone visit or just as a Duke chart visit.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:03:39
Okay, and so are you go ahead.

[Charles Carper] 13:03:40
Denny, could you, could you? Clarify for Shelby in the in the situation here is that what My chart is

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:03:50
Oh, my chart is a. It's a. Coordination with your doctors. There's a lot of information about it.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:04:01
I can look in there and I can see my previous appointments, my upcoming appointments, all my tests, all my labs.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:04:08
And other information that might be helpful to me. And.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:04:12
So you have to. You access that online. Okay. And then to get the conversation going to see if you need to be.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:04:16
Yes. I access that online.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:04:24
Visit your doctor in person or maybe another route. You have to start that process online or would you call?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:04:31
I can actually go in with. Hi, doctors and set up an appointment, but if it's the same day appointment or even a tomorrow or you know a sooner appointment then most of the time I send a message through the my chart to the doctor and when I when I send the message, I go in and ask to send the message and it shows me all my doctors.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:04:50
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:04:57
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:04:58
So I can choose the doctor. I need to see, not just my general practitioner, but the specialists as well.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:05:01
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:05:05
Oh, that's nice. Okay.

[Charles Carper] 13:05:06
Is the, this app we're talking about is it web or mobile or is it both?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:05:11
Both. Meaning I could get it on my computer or my phone. Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:05:13
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:05:17
What's more convenient for you? What do you usually opt for? On mobile.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:05:22
I usually use my laptop because I'm here, but I have used my phone. For instance, when I was in for, Pennsylvania.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:05:26
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:05:34
I needed some medication, so I just got on it and sent her a message and then she ordered the medication and sent it to Pennsylvania.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:05:43
Awesome. Do you feel like as soon as you log in? Do you find it's pretty click to get your message to the doctor or is it is it time consuming for you?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:05:54
No, it's pretty quick. It's pretty quick. And it also, It goes in between different hospitals or that I use.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:05:55
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:06:03
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:06:03
Like Johns Hopkins and Marilyn I've used so all my records from there can be sent.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:06:10
To my and in Maryland when we went to the doctors. They're connected to my chart so they can go in and.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:06:21
See what I had done there.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:06:22
That's nice. So it's not specific to this, a certain hospital or clinic.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:06:27
You, can jump around based on. Where you like going for different needs.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:06:30
That's correct. Yeah, sometimes they go to the University of North Carolina. You know, it shows on my lab test if I just go to an outside lab if my Duke doctor has ordered it or one of the other doctors.

[Charles Carper] 13:06:33
Denny.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:06:45
But right now I'm just with, but. Yeah, shows everything. It's really.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:06:48
Yeah.

[Charles Carper] 13:06:50
For connecting between the 2. Do you that did you have to do some prep work to get them to be connected like as in did you have to send did they request documents?

[Charles Carper] 13:07:01
Or does it do it unlikely?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:07:01
Well, there's a link online that you can go in and upload. Give permission. To the other hospitals to tag in.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:07:11
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:07:11
To the

[Charles Carper] 13:07:13
And is there specific hospitals like in a network? Like you can't just go to somewhere in California and expect to be connected or is it?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:07:20
I can if they're connected. Yeah, absolutely. If, if they're in connected to my chart.

[Charles Carper] 13:07:21
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 13:07:27
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:07:27
Then I can go in and my chart will allow them. Access or. The permission. To share the information.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:07:38
Okay. Okay. So are there any? Features or services that you wish.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:07:47
That my chart would offer you to kind of better meet your needs.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:07:52
Yeah, I would prefer that. They're connected to the VA system. And I would prefer that they're connected to because I use it.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:08:05
Try care for life and express scripts for my drugs. And I would prefer that all of that be connected.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:08:07
Okay. Thank you.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:08:13
Right now they're not.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:08:13
Okay, I see. So you have to go somewhere else to see. Yeah, how to get your prescriptions filled.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:08:21
It's not automatically. Synced after a visit, you have to look somewhere else other than my chart.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:08:27
To see that information. Oh. Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:08:27
No, no, that's not correct. Once my doctor orders it like with Walgreens.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:08:34
So I can go it. They have a choice. That I tell them I get my drugs or my medication from Walgreens.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:08:44
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:08:44
Or and a specific Walgreens. Or I can get it from express scripts. And the difference is if I need the medication right away to get started.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:08:54
Then I get it from Walgreens. Otherwise, I do the mail in prescription. From Express.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:08:59
I see. Okay, so when you have to get something mailed in, you're saying that's what's separate.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:09:06
Gotcha.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:09:06
Not, into them. The, the medication to me. Yes.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:09:09
To you. I understand. Okay. Got you.

[Charles Carper] 13:09:14
Is there a specific need or why you would do one over the other? Is it specific prescriptions?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:09:19
Yes, like, for instance, if I need, if I have the flu and I need a medication today.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:09:29
And I would do it for more. My Fiveroid medication. I usually have on hand so they do that from Experse Scripts automatically.

[Charles Carper] 13:09:31
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 13:09:41
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:09:41
Gotcha.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:09:41
So it's the main thing is express scripts will only allow you to. Or, immediate need medication.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:09:54
Hmm.

[Charles Carper] 13:09:54
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:09:54
And then you have to switch over because it's mailing system is cheaper. I have a 0 co payment with express grips.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:10:02
I do have a co payment. With wall creams. Or if it's a controlled drug. I have to do it through Walgreens initially.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:10:04
I understand. Okay.

[Charles Carper] 13:10:11
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:10:11
Gotcha. So you previously mentioned that, you already have your doctors chosen like you have the specialty doctors and your general practitioner.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:10:23
What if you had to choose from a list of doctors? What would, influence your decision to choose a doctor, would you say?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:10:32
Well, if I'm looking for a new doctor. I would, this is my personal, I go into Duke health.org.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:10:34
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:10:41
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:10:41
And they have. Gazillion doctors and I Look at the reviews. And I look at the doctors education.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:10:53
Personally, I like the fellows because they're all up to date with the information. So, and but sometimes if I'm doing something I may want.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:10:58
Thank you. Let me see.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:11:03
A more experienced doctor where I look at. Fellows is a group of Doctors who. Provide each other with the best information.

[Charles Carper] 13:11:05
What is fellows?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:11:16
They're all kept up to date. They're the latest and greatest.

[Charles Carper] 13:11:17
Okay. Gotcha. What about their, educational background? Does the meet your requirements?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:11:27
Yes, I that's part of the fellow because I do most of them do not always. But yes, I look at their education, I look at their profile that tells me.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:11:39
What they care and I kind of, what they, you know, they specialize in or they care about.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:11:47
And then I look at the reviews and I see if they marry up. That's my match.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:11:50
Gotcha. That's great. Okay. Let's see.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:11:53
Now if I could do that all in one place. That would be, you know. If they were connected to my chart, I would like that better.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:11:57
Yeah, that's great insights there.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:12:01
Awesome. Sure.

[Charles Carper] 13:12:02
I gotta follow up question to that. Dean, If that if you saw reviews.

[Charles Carper] 13:12:09
On a website for that doctor. And you saw those reviews, would you trust it? Or would you still go out and look for more reviews outside?

[Shelby Matthews] 13:12:20
Good question.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:12:20
I do both personally.

[Charles Carper] 13:12:21
You do both. Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:12:24
Alright, and then this.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:12:25
To me, the doctors. They're your lifeline. They're your important part. I don't have to like them personally.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:12:33
I do have to like what they do and how they. Succeed in treating their patients.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:12:40
Gotcha. So kinda similar. Is there anything else other than being able to look at reviews?

[Shelby Matthews] 13:12:47
And the credibility of the doctors what else makes you safe say if you need to, give the the web application, your personal.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:12:59
Information or medical information. Is there anything that would make you comfortable sharing that online?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:13:08
Not that I know of. I mean, unless it's a known, unless it's a known.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:13:10
Okay, you would rather do that.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:13:15
Proven safe place.

[Charles Carper] 13:13:17
How do you know that?

[Shelby Matthews] 13:13:17
Okay. Yeah.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:13:21
I don't and that's the problem. You know, normally like the My Chart, I know they're connected to the doctors and I know Duke's a good place and you can see it's a good place.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:13:22
Okay. I see. So.

[Charles Carper] 13:13:24
Yeah.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:13:34
And in the doctors that I have chosen that they all, now I take that back. A little bit because I went to Charlie and I went to a dermatologist.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:13:45
Here in Carey. He, he seemed like a really good guy. But then his system was. Compromised.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:13:54
Hmm. Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:13:55
So that immediately made me change doctors.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:14:00
Okay. Good information.

[Charles Carper] 13:14:00
Okay. Do you think, other things that might make you feel safe on somebody's website is like, Recommendations somebody told you that it was great so you just believe them and then you go.

[Charles Carper] 13:14:14
On the website and use it. Or anything. Of that nature.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:14:17
Well, it would have to be somebody like Heather that I really trusted. And I know she's a stickler, so that would that would be a point.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:14:27
But it's not just.

[Charles Carper] 13:14:27
So somebody would respect who would give you a recommendation. You would feel like okay so let's say when COVID popped off and it was very the getting the COVID vaccination was very like hard to get and if all these like.

[Charles Carper] 13:14:39
Smaller. Pharmaceutical places were popping up. You know, how do you trust them?

[Charles Carper] 13:14:47
You know, and so like. Somebody had to go and test it out. Be like, hey, I got it.

[Charles Carper] 13:14:53
I feel, I feel fine. So, I mean.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:14:54
Now I did with that. I did. I trusted my neighbors. They were good people.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:14:59
Well, I say word. They don't live here anymore. They're good people. And, That's where they went and I didn't know where else to go.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:15:08
So that's where I went. And it worked out great.

[Charles Carper] 13:15:09
Okay, so, your close connections recommendations was important to you.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:15:16
Yes, yes.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:15:19
In my chart is asking does keep a record of. Of some of your medical information. Or is it more just?

[Shelby Matthews] 13:15:30
So you can contact your providers.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:15:32
No, when I go to the doctor. She sends an after visit report. And that's on my chart.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:15:38
Okay. Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:15:40
And then within that she has recommendations. For things that she would like to see me do and I can choose may or may not do them.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:15:49
There's no like check the block Did you do this or did you do that? And all my lab reports are there.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:15:52
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:15:59
All my, test are there. And all my personal information is there. And when you go in like a They have a pre registration.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:16:12
So if I make an appointment and then I'm gonna go in tomorrow, then I go in to my chart and I.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:16:20
Update on my insurance just like a pre check-in. It is a pre check-in and I am for make sure all my information is correct and then they they also have a screening or illness screening if you have a flu or if you have, you know, a headache fever, blah, blah, blah.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:16:24
Gotcha.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:16:40
That you check it before you go.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:16:43
And you are feel safe with that. Platform and you're comfortable with it just because. We've used it for a long time or do, is there, yeah, or is there anything else?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:16:51
Yes.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:16:54
That makes you feel safe with that specific My Chart platform.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:16:59
No, I think it's just because I, it has to do with the reputation of Duke.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:17:04
Okay, I see.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:17:05
And that I've used it for a long time.

[Charles Carper] 13:17:08
Shelby, you know what Duke is?

[Shelby Matthews] 13:17:08
Okay, do you know? No. Is it a university hospital?

[Charles Carper] 13:17:13
Can you? Yeah.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:17:13
Oh. Yeah, Duke University Hospital and they have the school where they have all the Guru doctors and they that's where they do the most training and VA hospital actually is right beside Duke Hospital and a lot of the Duke doctors.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:17:17
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:17:22
Gotcha.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:17:33
Volunteer. At the VA and that's where my husband goes. So.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:17:34
Okay, at the, I see. That's nice. That's nice. Okay, that's good to know.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:17:42
Awesome. Alright, let's see. So let's say after you book the appointment with your doctor online.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:17:52
Between the time you book and between the time you show up to your appointment. Is there any additional information that you would find helpful to know?

[Shelby Matthews] 13:18:02
Before your point.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:18:05
In that person, specific. Program. Some doctors allow you to cancel or reschedule online and some don't, you still have to call.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:18:17
Okay. I see. Gotcha. It's not it's not consistent to know.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:18:18
But that's a little inconvenient if you wake up and you're sick and you don't wanna go.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:18:23
For instance. Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:18:26
Because they're it's not the same. And also whenever they're giving you the information.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:18:33
Follow up after your doctor appointment you said that they provide you with like follow up instructions. Right. Yeah.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:18:39
An app to visit summary and that tells. What they found and what they advise.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:18:45
And you do access that in my chart. Okay, okay, alright.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:18:47
Yes. Actually get an email telling me it's there.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:18:52
Okay, good. So you do get an email. So also after making the appointment, how do you remember?

[Shelby Matthews] 13:19:00
To show up.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:19:02
I use Google. Calendar.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:19:05
Okay, alright. And, Great.

[Charles Carper] 13:19:07
How did it get into your Google Calendar? How did it get into your Google Calendar?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:19:09
I'm sorry.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:19:14
No, that's not in my Google calendar. I put it there. Is that what you're asking?

[Shelby Matthews] 13:19:17
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 13:19:17
How do, how do you get the appointment into your calendar?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:19:21
I manually put it there.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:19:23
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 13:19:23
Okay, so you set up an appointment and then they say confirmation, you got an appointment set for this time and date and then you take that and go to your calendar and you plug it in.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:19:33
Correct. Now I would prefer that it automatically go there or be allowed to automatically go there. And it may, I just don't know how to use it.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:19:34
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 13:19:34
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:19:43
I don't know. That part I don't know.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:19:44
Hmm. That's all right. That's not your fault. And if it's not super simple to see.

[Charles Carper] 13:19:45
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:19:47
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:19:49
And also Let's see what else. Do they email you? Or you only are reminded from that manual calendar.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:19:59
That you set up. Okay. Just.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:19:59
No, they email me with a check in. Like, so like the day before I'll get a an email and it has a link or Maybe it says it confirm with yes and.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:20:13
And change it with no. Something like that. It just tells me.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:20:15
Gotcha. And it at least tells you the time and the date on that. Okay. And then, and then you would jump into the pre check in process.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:20:23
Correct.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:20:24
Okay. Sure.

[Charles Carper] 13:20:24
I got a follow up for that. they, if you use the app or the web application, you signed up and everything.

[Charles Carper] 13:20:33
Does further communication happen within the app or does it happen via text? Or email like what is the flow of kind of how it goes.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:20:44
You mean if they send like the confirmation they're sending me and stuff? Is that what you're?

[Charles Carper] 13:20:48
Yeah, so you want to stop an appointment. And you say, hey, I need to set up for this date.

[Charles Carper] 13:20:53
Do they give you dates inside the app that you have to choose or do they say is it all within the message system and someone's right back to you and says, hey, we got this day or this day available, which works for you.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:21:04
If I'm making the appointment on. Phone over the phone, then they give me a specific appointment.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:21:12
Oh. For the appointment second book online. I booked them directly. For instance, if I, I'm sorry, if I go to the, I forget what they call it, but like the quick wellness center, you just go and you don't, you know, you got a headache or whatever.

[Charles Carper] 13:21:20
Okay, you choose the date.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:21:33
If I go there, I can just make the appointment set the time and go.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:21:38
Okay. Depends on where you're going.

[Charles Carper] 13:21:38
Okay. Hey.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:21:40
If you could such a big hospital and they're so booked all the time. You know, so they're really good though about If the doctor has to cancel.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:21:52
Of letting me know and that's via email. Yeah, he doesn't do that so well.

[Charles Carper] 13:21:55
Sure.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:21:59
And they don't notify you at all hardly. Sometimes they phone, some of them.

[Charles Carper] 13:22:03
I have a question about when, when you sign in or log in. With your My Chart. And then when you actually show up to the physical hospital.

[Charles Carper] 13:22:12
Does it know that you're there? Is there a way that it connects somehow or does it does it seem like they send you a notification?

[Charles Carper] 13:22:19
Hey, you're in the proximity area. We checked you in. Do you ever see anything like that?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:22:23
No, what they do is, some of them have a kiosk and you can go sign in.

[Charles Carper] 13:22:29
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:22:31
But most people don't. Most people still go to the desk and use. The receptionist.

[Charles Carper] 13:22:37
Gotcha.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:22:37
Okay. And so when you do check in with the receptionist or however you check in, you don't know how long you're waiting.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:22:47
It's supposed to be within 15 min. And when they send you the after visit survey, they ask you that.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:22:50
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:22:54
Okay, do you think that's typically your experience is that it's within the 15 min? Cool.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:23:00
Didn't used to be, but yeah, it was here.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:23:01
I got you. Good. At least they improve that. That's cool.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:23:06
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:23:06
Alright. Okay. I think, I think that's it. Unless you have any other specific follow ups.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:23:14
Charles.

[Charles Carper] 13:23:16
Let me take a quick look over.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:23:19
Yep.

[Charles Carper] 13:23:22
No, II think that's all the questions that we have

[Shelby Matthews] 13:23:25
Great. Awesome. You were. I was very helpful.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:23:26
I hope I was helpful.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:23:31
Thank you so much for that and. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask us.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:23:36
Now, and if not. We were, we're gonna. We're gonna design something and we're gonna be testing that design to improve.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:23:39
No.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:23:48
An online booking. App that we have been assigned. So is it something you would like to participate in when we go?

[Shelby Matthews] 13:23:56
When we wanna test that out if we send you a link to it. Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:23:58
Sure. It might have been more helpful to you if we had done the VA because they're not quite as.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:24:07
Well, it's helpful to see it's helpful to see that you have good experiences, I think, so that we know how if we don't recognize those good experiences in that we're, improving, then we can no, to add that in, you know.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:24:09
User friendly.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:24:24
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:24:24
. That makes sense True.

[Charles Carper] 13:24:24
Well, we can ask her what are like just name like one pain point that you have with the VA.

[Charles Carper] 13:24:31
What is something you really don't like?

[Shelby Matthews] 13:24:31
Yeah, there you go.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:24:32
Well, one pain point with the VA is You can't make your appointments online at all.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:24:39
Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:24:40
They have the kiosk, but they never work. When you get there and sometimes they just cancel appointments and unless I go in, which I have to because I have to know, unless I go in and look at my appointment schedule.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:24:44
Hmm.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:25:00
I just did that the other day, you know, he had an appointment. I went in and look, they had moved it.

[Charles Carper] 13:25:06
Hmm.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:25:06
Oh.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:25:06
And move the appointment to another month. So that's a little. Irritating a lot.

[Charles Carper] 13:25:10
Wow.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:25:12
Thanks.

[Charles Carper] 13:25:14
And anything digital that you go in and it's just horrible experience for the VA, like is there a website?

[Charles Carper] 13:25:22
Bad?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:25:22
Their website is not that bad. It's pretty much the same. I can go in and I can see his doctors and I can send them a message if I have a point of contention.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:25:36
Now the doctors themselves. They're great. You know, try, he just had some x rays of his hands and knees.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:25:43
And I went in and I saw the results online. And I went in and I sent a message to the doctor and said, I think we need to talk about these and he did a phone visit with us.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:25:59
And explained everything what the x-rays meant and that was really helpful.

[Charles Carper] 13:26:04
Okay, so you appreciated that when you had some kind of issue you contacted the doctor and he just you know set up a time for a call visit.

[Charles Carper] 13:26:12
And you, you like that, yeah. Okay.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:26:12
Correct. Yeah, yeah, that's a good. The canceling the appointments when you don't know it is.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:26:21
Yeah, that's, yeah, that's frustrating because you could show up.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:26:21
That's a little. So there should be an automatic. If the can't the appointments cancelled, it should automatically shoot me.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:26:31
Within the system. An email that says, hey, this been cancelled and this has been rescheduled.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:26:36
You know.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:26:36
Definitely.

[Charles Carper] 13:26:37
Do you think that the email would have been the fastest way for you to get that information or text or even a phone call?

[Charles Carper] 13:26:44
Like what would work better in order that you think would be most useful?

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:26:48
Well, sometimes they call and that's helpful because they're not gonna look at my calendar instead of them just assigning me one.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:26:56
And I can look at the calendar and say, yeah, you know, we're free that day.

[Charles Carper] 13:27:00
Gotcha.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:27:00
But. An email or text either one I'm happy with both just Give me the information.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:27:01
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 13:27:09
Yeah.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:27:10
So, and that could be an option for specific people. Everybody process information differently.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:27:20
Sure. Yep. Okay, that was good. Good additional info to have on some pain points there.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:27:28
Alright, so I think that's it. I think that wraps this up. Really appreciate you.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:27:32
Alright. You're welcome. You're welcome.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:27:34
It's nice to meet you.

[Charles Carper] 13:27:35
Thanks, Grandma. I, I think, so when we get closer to the end and we start designing this up this flow out, we'll have some like screenshots or some like a whole flow where you can see and you can click it and then you can give us more opinion what your opinion is are on.

[Charles Carper] 13:27:49
How it feels or looks and then that'll help us even further make it better.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:27:54
Okay, am I also allowed to do the wording? Get out myself. Yeah. Yeah.

[Charles Carper] 13:27:58
She's, she's an editor, Shelby.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:28:01
We would really appreciate that. I think that's not our strong suit either of us. So. You're not gonna insult this.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:28:06
I just don't want to insult anybody.

[Charles Carper] 13:28:06
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Grandma, let's take a quick screenshot, a selfie.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:28:11
I'm not perfect, but when I see it, I can't help myself. Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 13:28:14
That's good. Oh yeah.

[Deanie Deitterick] 13:28:18
Yeah. Okay. Okay

[Charles Carper] 13:28:19
It's gonna be for our portfolio. Okay. So I'm gonna count it off.

[Charles Carper] 13:28:22
Alright, so 3, 2, one. Got it. Alright, thank you
