14:03:57 Did you see that? Okay.
14:03:58 Yeah, I was wondering if maybe there's something weird about. Having the recording pause. I just
14:04:02 Looks like he's joining. Yeah, it looks like he's joining again on a different device.
14:04:10 Okay.
14:04:11 Caleb, I see your mics open on one of them. I now you open your mic.
14:04:21 You might have to change the default. Go into the, settings.
14:04:36 Remembering how to even change my
14:04:40 Settings on here.
14:04:44 Good. Good. Microphone and then see which. System microphone is set.
14:05:17 Okay. And say we could switch to Google, but I think. We would just have to record it and then figure out a different way to get it transcription.
14:05:29 That would be easier.
14:05:31 Yeah, I don't know. Let's just see what. He gets here.
14:05:37 Okay.
14:05:37 Looks like he's trying things.
14:05:48 Hey, it ain't working on that. It's not giving me another audio option. Okay
14:05:59 Sometimes it. Changes the defaults on. Yeah.
14:06:30 He said it's not working, giving It's not giving him another audio option.
14:06:39 But he can hear us.
14:06:57 Hey, Caleb, when you click on the microphone bottom left, there's like a, a carrot that you can open up options.
14:07:05 I was on the
14:07:05 Does it does it give you options?
14:07:26 No, it only gives me computer.
14:07:29 There must be some off of the computer.
14:07:34 Okay.
14:07:33 Trying to connect via phone. Okay.
14:07:42 Okay, phone instructions.
14:07:45 Okay.
14:07:54 Are you okay? On time?
14:07:54 Yes. Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty much told them I've got meetings from one to 5.
14:08:01 So.
14:08:02 Oh, that's good.
14:08:03 Oh, technically till 6, I guess. But yeah.
14:08:42 Yep, I got ya.
14:08:40 Is that working now? Holy cow.
14:08:46 Seems like a lot.
14:08:47 That was frustrating for you. I'm sorry.
14:08:49 Let me good. No, it's because of the company I work for. They block all these kind of things and I gotta find ways around it.
14:08:57 They locked it down on you. What about your camera?
14:09:04 Are you on here?
14:09:08 Oh, gotcha.
14:09:00 Yeah, they lock the cameras for Facetime. They lock them. On the phone, on the phone they do because Yeah, it's weird.
14:09:13 I don't know. They have so many weird security things.
14:09:15 Yeah, yeah. Okay, so you're on your phone and your videos locked up. Or that but you can do audio.
14:09:24 Okay, let me double check that the transcripts recording. Do you see it on your end?
14:09:31 I've got it.
14:09:22 Yeah, I got audio. I can see you. So same recording up in the corner.
14:09:35 Yeah, we've got the transcript.
14:09:37 Okay, good. Okay, you hit record, right?
14:09:40 Yeah, we're recording. Alright, so yeah.
14:09:42 Okay. All right. Hey, Caleb. We're gonna have, we're gonna have Shelby do kick off the.
14:09:45 Okay.
14:09:49 The interview, okay? Since I know you personally will have her do it and then she'll. Ask you the questions.
14:09:58 Okay, and I might step in and say a few things. You know, if I need more clarification, okay?
14:10:00 Yep, got it.
14:10:01 Alright, so this is Shelby, my teammate and we're, we're doing, designers.
14:10:09 So here, take it away, Shelby.
14:10:09 Okay, yeah, and we are recording. And I'm reading from a script. Are you comfortable with that?
14:10:16 Yeah.
14:10:14 That we're recording this? Is gonna be anonymous. Okay. All your information.
14:10:19 Yep.
14:10:20 Okay. Alright, so yeah, this is so that we can, hear about your experiences, thoughts, suggestions regarding online booking processes for.
14:10:32 Doctors appointments So we have a scripted questions and we're gonna start by asking you some background questions.
14:10:39 Okay. Alright, so where are you located?
14:10:44 North Carolina, Shelby, North Carolina.
14:10:47 Okay. Alright, do you typically prefer in person, Dr. Consultations or would you prefer having a consultation online?
14:11:01 Recently. Recently the online thing. Actually works out better for me.
14:11:07 Okay.
14:11:07 But I just started, I've only done that twice. But I do, I do like that.
14:11:13 Option.
14:11:15 What made it better?
14:11:14 Okay.
14:11:18 The what?
14:11:19 What made it better? Why, why do you like that over the other options?
14:11:23 I think it's just more convenient like when you're sick, you don't feel like leaving the house, especially if it's something simple.
14:11:29 Like for me, I have bad allergies. I get sinus infection several times a year.
14:11:33 I know what the issue is. I don't need to go see somebody. I can just call somebody and be like, hey.
14:11:39 I have a sinus infection. I need something to So give me a little boost here and they just prescribe it over the phone.
14:11:46 It's Super easy.
14:11:48 So instead, so like the instead of going in setting appointments to see a doctor. You schedule something and then they give you a prescription, you go straight to the CBS and that's even that's easier than going to the doctor talking about it and then waiting the next day to get.
14:12:03 Medicine. Right.
14:12:05 Yeah. Yeah, for me it's always some kind of science infection or ear infection. And I already know what I need for the most part.
14:12:16 Right.
14:12:14 I've been doing this my whole life. So in a situation like that in my situation, I like it, but I could see if it's something oddball that you would want to see a doctor so that they could actually look at you and you you can show them your symptoms, you know, but.
14:12:30 Sure, we'll tell you tell us more about that. Why do you think that's better doing it in person?
14:12:36 Versus doing it online.
14:12:38 It would only be better. For something that's not a typical. Scenario for me. So, I mean, I rarely, I'll just use the flu as an example.
14:12:52 I rarely get the flu. I might have had it once in my life. Like that would be maybe something where I'm not.
14:13:02 This is normal for me. So is it is the flu? Is it COVID? What is it?
14:13:08 Go see the doctor in person. And they can kinda run through different options and diagnose you. Better than over the phone or over the internet.
14:13:17 I see. So you think that going to a doctor in person is more accurate than a doctor just looking at you and hearing you over the phone.
14:13:27 Or even online. Yeah.
14:13:27 Yeah. Definitely more thorough.
14:13:31 Yeah. Gotcha. Gotcha.
14:13:34 Sounds good. Alright, you and giving us like an age range. Your age range. Oh, yeah.
14:13:41 Oh, I'm 36. I don't know how you want between 35.
14:13:46 Whatever.
14:13:45 Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. That's fine, easy if you're comfortable with your, that works.
14:13:50 Hmm.
14:13:52 Okay, so what's your job or what industry are you working in?
14:13:56 I'm a plastics engineer.
14:13:59 Okay. Okay. Alright, so now we're gonna go into our regular questions. Those are all the background questions we have.
14:14:09 Do you mind sharing your recent experience of booking a doctor's appointment online? Did you have any challenges?
14:14:18 Or difficulties during that process?
14:14:21 Yeah, I actually went through the process this morning via 2 different methods. To prepare for this.
14:14:30 Yeah.
14:14:32 So I'm in the atrium health system. I have a profile on their website and everything.
14:14:39 So I thought, oh, well, this should be an easy option. Although I've not used that option before.
14:14:43 When I go on and sign into the app. And you know click find appointment or Yeah, have an appointment or set up an appointment and.
14:14:54 It was kind of a mess. It was. I took some notes, but.
14:15:00 The first question was like, what type of care? Do you need, which that's a very reasonable question to ask.
14:15:08 But then it gives you a list. It doesn't let you type anything in or, you know.
14:15:13 An easy way of doing it. It gives you a list. And I felt like the more common things.
14:15:21 That you would see a doctor for at least in my scenario. Was at the very bottom of that list like I had to scroll down quite a ways to select just, adult sickness.
14:15:36 Right.
14:15:34 Type thing. You know what I mean? Most of them were. I mean, I had to scroll past like pregnancy.
14:15:42 I just scroll past, COVID-19 vaccinations. I just scroll past flu vaccinations.
14:15:47 I had to scroll past, a lot of things before I just got to a regular, whatever sickness.
14:15:53 Interesting. Okay, that's good.
14:15:53 Huh. So that was kind of odd to me. The second thing after that once I selected the care that I needed.
14:16:03 It asked me for location. Well, I'm in there system. I'm I'm assigned to a doctor in their system and it's asking me for location.
14:16:14 So I thought that was odd and then when I looked at the location options, it was kind of the same thing.
14:16:21 It was like the first several options were options that were 50 miles away from me. Instead of the ones right here in town that are 5 miles away from me.
14:16:31 Okay.
14:16:30 So I thought that was. And then when I selected the. The office that I usually go to and then I'm assigned to I selected them and this response was There's no available times for this office.
14:16:49 Hmm. Yeah. I could see that.
14:16:51 So I thought that was not and that was pretty much where I just stopped.
14:16:58 Okay.
14:16:56 Understood. Alright.
14:16:57 Okay, so you got to a point where you were blocked because It wasn't the hospital or the office that you wanted to go to.
14:17:07 Even though you know that there was that was available.
14:17:11 Well, yeah, that wasn't the first option. I had I had to scroll down to find the office that I wanted to go to and then even when I said, and it told me, no, there's no options here.
14:17:19 Okay
14:17:23 Like there's no available times here.
14:17:25 Hmm.
14:17:25 Okay, so yeah, you get a push back even further to find more times.
14:17:32 Okay.
14:17:30 I didn't really search. How much further into it I just kind of stopped there.
14:17:36 Sure. That's a good. That's a good idea. Like why you stopped at that point.
14:17:41 Yep. Alright. What do you think?
14:17:45 What are some factors that influence your decision to book a doctor's appointment online, especially when you need immediate medical attention or medical attention the same day.
14:18:00 Hmm. I don't know personally, I think I would rather. Just call them up and schedule something, but.
14:18:12 That's good. Alright.
14:18:16 I think, it maybe if you can thank
14:18:14 I don't know. I know a lot of people that I wouldn't. 1, 2.
14:18:21 Yeah, I think, an example, and maybe the hearing the example might help you think about what's what's next but like let's say you got SIM of COVID.
14:18:34 You know, and you had to make a same day because you wanted to get tested. That's kinda like along the lines of like.
14:18:38 Hmm.
14:18:45 Right.
14:18:40 Can I see a doctor today? Can I go in and go get? Signed up for it. Do you think that there's anything about that?
14:18:51 What was the question again, experience booking.
14:18:53 Well, yeah, I don't know. I mean. It's basically just trying to see is there anything that really would make him want to book.
14:19:04 A doctor's appointment online to get same day care and I think he already answered. He said he'd rather just call.
14:19:10 So I think that's kinda it.
14:19:13 Right. Yeah.
14:19:08 Yeah, yeah unless certain circumstances. Yeah, okay. Let's move on.
14:19:16 Alright.
14:19:17 I wonder, I wonder, I don't know, my brain's going now, but I wonder too if I would have selected, COVID related.
14:19:23 Symptoms if they wouldn't have made me more priority on the website if it would have filtered me a different way.
14:19:30 Yeah, that's a good question.
14:19:31 I'm not sure.
14:19:29 Gotcha. So like if your concern is only to see the doctor and you don't care how you might just say, oh I got COVID symptoms and then.
14:19:41 Yeah.
14:19:42 Yeah, maybe.
14:19:41 Get booked up and then and then go see like actually I got this.
14:19:45 Yeah.
14:19:48 Right. Like you're pregnant.
14:19:54 Alright.
14:19:45 Yeah, maybe I don't know. Yeah. I'd be curious to know how that worked if I should something different.
14:19:54 Okay. Yeah. Yeah
14:19:57 But so on, on the other side of that, so once I gave up on, system I went to just like the way I typically do it is I just go to the minute clinic which is 2 miles from my house.
14:20:10 And it's it's convenient for me because II can see the doctor it's usually something simple.
14:20:17 And I can get my medicine while I'm there. It's not like multiple trips. So I went on to see VS, to book a to book a appointment.
14:20:28 And it asked me basically the same thing. You asked me, you know, what's my illness?
14:20:32 And I could type in there like I just For giggles I put in, fever.
14:20:38 Okay.
14:20:38 And it gave me a drop in on a different fever scenarios. I mean, it was super fast.
14:20:46 Then it just. Once you selected whatever flew. Good ask for your zip code, type in my zip code, the one right here in town was the first one on the list.
14:20:55 I selected it and it gave me the next available appointment and I was done.
14:21:00 Hmm.
14:21:01 I mean it was super fast and very convenient to do it through the CDS system for some reason.
14:21:07 Gotcha. Okay, so let's go over that flow. So you said, You went to the CVS app.
14:21:15 And what was the next step?
14:21:18 Yeah, so I just I just googled actually Google Maps, CBS, pull up the website.
14:21:22 Okay.
14:21:25 Hit you know minute clinic and then set up set an appointment. And the first question it asked me was what illness are you having?
14:21:34 You start typing something in there and it pops up with all the different options that could be related to your symptom that you typed in.
14:21:41 You select one, you type in the zip code that you're looking for, gives you the options in that zip code.
14:21:48 And then you select the location that you want and it gives you the next available time and then that's it.
14:21:54 That 1,000. Okay.
14:21:55 Oh, so, so easy. Big difference.
14:21:59 Okay, can you talk to me about the visuals of that, right? Like what did you see on the app that made you feel like, oh, this is good?
14:22:07 Or was there anything confusing about that?
14:22:10 No, it's flowed very well and everything was right there in front of me. I felt like the whole time it wasn't.
14:22:21 Okay. Okay.
14:22:18 Wasn't really like I had to search for it for anything that I was trying to do. Seemed like it was done pretty well.
14:22:27 Thanks. Alright, that's it for me.
14:22:34 Yeah.
14:22:32 So when you're looking at a list of doctors for an appointment you're trying to book. What factors kind of influence your decision.
14:22:49 II don't know. I don't know if I've ever had. Choose through a list of actual doctors before
14:22:57 That's fine.
14:22:59 I don't know if I have any feedback for that one.
14:23:02 Okay.
14:23:01 Have you ever went to a massage therapist?
14:23:06 Never.
14:23:08 Have you ever went to a specialist where You would go somewhere and People were specialized. Let's say let's say chiropractor or physical therapy.
14:23:19 Yeah, I've been a chiropractor.
14:23:21 Did when you go to their website that they have special doctors that you can go to this doctor who can help take care of you or you can go to this trainer or special doctors that you can go to this doctor who can help take care of you or you can go to this trainer or this specific person.
14:23:32 Yeah, I've never, that.
14:23:35 I like that idea.
14:23:37 Yeah.
14:23:34 Okay, okay, that's okay. Yeah That's kinda like how some of these specialists are like there's doctors and then that are general and then there's like your specialists, right?
14:23:48 And so some of the times when you go to a specialist like somebody who does dental work or somebody does, masseuse, something like that they'll have a list of
14:23:57 Who they have there and then they have a breakdown of that profile of that person and you know because for some places like this they're very like Somebody wants a male, somebody wants a female, somebody wants someone who's gonna be very strong when it comes to massaging, you know, me, so the details matter to some people.
14:24:15 And so same thing for doctors or on these things. So. But if you haven't had experience with it, we can move on.
14:24:22 Okay.
14:24:24 Yeah.
14:24:23 Yeah. Alright. Are there any like specific features or services you kind of wish a platform would offer when you're trying to book an online doctors appointment.
14:24:54 I don't I can't think of anything off top my head.
14:24:54 It's okay. That's alright.
14:24:57 So let's think of your scenario that you had about the flu. You got the flu. And you've got symptoms of the flu, do you?
14:25:06 Wish that It was easier, like, but what would make it easier?
14:25:16 Like selecting my symptoms.
14:25:18 Or just like wanting to go see the doctor period. Like right now, boom, you got symptoms.
14:25:25 Like, I need to go see the doctor. I think I need to go see him. Do you decide I need to go in person or decide you can just do it online.
14:25:30 Okay.
14:25:31 And how do you decide that and what makes what makes you determine? I'm gonna go in.
14:25:39 I think, yeah, I think for me in my scenario, if it's something that Hey, Z is a normal scenario for me, such as my allergies.
14:25:47 Yeah.
14:25:50 Yeah, yeah.
14:25:49 If it's allergy related, if it's. I think I'm comfortable not seeing the doctor.
14:25:56 But if it was something more major. Well, something not even more major, but just not as routine for me.
14:26:05 Then I would feel more comfortable seeing a doctor. And I would wanna see. Somebody face to face. Those.
14:26:16 Do what?
14:26:12 Gotcha. I think the root of this question. Is more like I'm thinking through this question right now.
14:26:20 I'm trying to think, how can I ask it in a different way but like. Something like, like an example would be you're talking about that you have allergies and it's a system that you get pretty often and sometimes it would be.
14:26:31 Nice to just talk to somebody and then then prescribe you. You're MEDs, right?
14:26:38 So what if we can shorten that? You log in with your email address or just even your birthday and they automatically know that.
14:26:53 Okay.
14:26:48 You pretty much book up every quarter allergy medicines. If they call and say, are you calling about your allergy medicines and you type in one and they says, would you like the prescription?
14:27:00 You type in one and then you like boom, that was your. You didn't have to even talk to anybody.
14:27:04 It was just automated, like something like that.
14:27:09 Yeah.
14:27:04 Yeah, That would be convenience. Yeah. I feel like they do, I feel like they do make you at least talk to somebody.
14:27:14 Yeah
14:27:14 But it would be I don't, yeah, I think if you have a history of running history on their website, that would be neat if they did track that and eliminate a step if possible.
14:27:25 Yeah. Is there anything else in that same like, mindset that you think would be even like that would be cool?
14:27:35 Yeah.
14:27:40 Yeah, I can't think of anything. Same.
14:27:42 That's okay. That's okay. So it's about it's about like making it more of comfortable and fast so if you call in and whatever the way that is online but then there's another step of paying for it.
14:27:57 Or even like confirming your information, what if you had you know, all the document medical documents to prove or even to make sure that they don't give you bad drugs or something like that.
14:28:08 You know, that's gonna conflict with other stuff you have. So I'm just brainstorming on top of my head, but we could do that later.
14:28:15 I was just hoping that would spark something.
14:28:18 Yeah.
14:28:19 Alright, you can go ahead and do the next one.
14:28:21 Sure. Yeah, like you think of anything that might make it easier for you to. Find an appointment that fits your schedule.
14:28:31 Yeah. Oh yeah.
14:28:32 Compared to what you've. Already tried.
14:28:37 I mean, I can't say that there would be a way to optimize the CBS one because it gave me the most recent or the gave me the next available appointment and then if I didn't want to select that available appointment.
14:28:56 Okay.
14:28:51 You gave me the other options and then it gave me the whole calendar of available times. You know, so I thought that pretty nice.
14:29:00 Hmm
14:29:00 What about like reminders or notifications? Can you think of anything? Your ideal way to get reminded or notified that you have an upcoming appointment?
14:29:12 During that, you know, after booking online.
14:29:18 Okay.
14:29:13 I, yeah, I don't, I didn't actually book it so I don't know if they would have sent me a a text saying, hey, thanks for booking.
14:29:23 You're with CBS. But I know like my Dennis, for example, Cause I booked them 6 months or a year out, you know, once a year.
14:29:32 It's like, I forget that I even have an appointment and. 5 days before I have an appointment, they'll send me a text message and then the day before I have an appointment, they'll send me another text message.
14:29:45 Alright, and so.
14:29:42 And it's all that's all automated, so that's kinda nice. Okay.
14:29:45 On a scale one at 10, how do you like that automated text? Text system. You like it.
14:29:50 Hi Mike. Yeah, I like it. Cause I would definitely forget if I didn't have that.
14:29:54 Oh, that's nice. Okay.
14:29:58 So.
14:29:57 Sweet. So if CVS were to be able to offer that, that'd be good with you.
14:30:03 And that. That'd be in a good approach for you.
14:30:04 I think, I think so with CVS. Hello, and the way I would use it, it's more of a same day or as soon as possible type or deal.
14:30:15 It's like I won't, I'm sick. I won't, like as quickly as I can to get better.
14:30:24 Sure.
14:30:24 Right.
14:30:19 Whereas I guess the dentist is kind of More drone out. So there's I could see a place for both those options I guess.
14:30:30 With or without.
14:30:32 Gotcha. Alright. So maybe after booking a doctor's appointment. You've completed all the steps.
14:30:41 Is there any like additional information that might be helpful for you to know? Before you. Have to go to your
14:30:53 Hmm.
14:30:57 Yes, it would be, yeah, like it would be nice because sometimes you show up at these appointments and they're running behind or.
14:31:08 They're not on schedule for whatever reason. So it'd be nice to be like, hey, we're running a little bit behind.
14:31:15 Your new time is, this and you don't have to show up for until that time.
14:31:22 That would be kinda convenient.
14:31:24 Yeah.
14:31:24 Yeah, for sure. Good idea.
14:31:25 Hello, I know my wife that happens to her every single month when she goes to her doctor. She shows up at her time and she waits an hour to get seen.
14:31:33 They're always behind.
14:31:36 So now.
14:31:36 Yeah.
14:31:34 Yeah, what about seeing a doctor like in that scenario where you have to sit there in a queue and wait?
14:31:42 Is there anything that would make you feel more comfortable?
14:31:48 Sitting in a doctor office.
14:31:50 Yeah, like are we, I don't know.
14:31:55 I don't know if I wanna ask it that way. I do wanna ask you for in the sense of online.
14:32:01 Okay. So let's say you book, a meeting for online.
14:32:05 Thank you.
14:32:08 After you After you make the appointment. And it's the same day appointment. From the time that you book the appointment to the time you go into it.
14:32:20 What are some things that maybe be helpful? To know like How long you're gonna have to wait or if you're backed up in the queue or is there other stuff that you think that would be good information to make you feel comfortable that.
14:32:37 You're next or anything like that?
14:32:40 I mean, I guess there's some room there for
14:32:48 For things like that. So if you're, say like today. You know, I was booking at 90'clock in the morning, but the time was at 20'clock and I had that time to sit around and wait.
14:33:01 Nice maybe an hour ahead to be like, hey, there's this many people in front of you and we're this.
14:33:06 We're on track or whatever and maybe. Based on the based on the illness that you selected as.
14:33:15 At least the way CVS went. I typed in an illness. I had a fever.
14:33:20 Maybe they know. Or how a track record of what other people. Are having the same symptoms for and just say this is something that's been going around in the area the last couple of weeks maybe it's this but Just something to.
14:33:36 Kind of get you thinking of. What it might be. Would be maybe a good idea.
14:33:43 Like time wise or expectations on how long wait.
14:33:48 Yeah, that and even like a just something like a pre diagnosis almost just like hey we know some we know this is going around.
14:33:58 And, you know, we this could be it, just something to ease your mind if you're a worrywart maybe.
14:34:07 Okay.
14:34:06 Not that I am, but I know some people that every time they sneeze, they freak out.
14:34:13 That's a good idea.
14:34:13 Yeah Okay. Was that our last question?
14:34:17 I think we were, I think we've got one more time for one more question or like, I'm getting a warning that was going like 5 min left.
14:34:11 And they think they Hello.
14:34:26 Okay.
14:34:26 I was gonna say. Alright, so like on a scale from one to 10. How comfortable would you say you are with sharing personal and medical information online while you're booking something online.
14:34:42 Like medical information as in medical history.
14:34:41 For a doctor's office. Yeah, anything like that.
14:34:49 Or like my insurance or
14:34:52 Yeah, all of the above. Are you comfortable with that? Putting all that online.
14:34:53 Oh. I, yeah. I'm okay. I mean, yeah, I do it and I don't really think about it.
14:35:04 Okay.
14:35:04 I mean, So I would say I'm all right with it.
14:35:07 Alright, is there anything that might make you more comfortable? Putting all that on line? Thanks, specific about the platform.
14:35:18 I don't think so.
14:35:16 That makes you more comfortable. Then maybe. Alright.
14:35:20 How about this? What about what are some things that might make you feel like Absolutely not. I'm not put my information up there.
14:35:31 Okay.
14:35:29 I mean, I've never put my Social Security out. That's just something that's just me and And I never really have to, I find.
14:35:37 I mean, if you don't put it on there, it's not like they stop you.
14:35:37 Yeah. Gotcha.
14:35:39 So I mean, other than that. And even in today's world, I don't even think that's as important as it used to be.
14:35:46 Yeah. Gotcha.
14:35:46 But. It's not a habit, that's what I do. Another, yeah, I mean, unless they're asking me.
14:35:53 For a credit card or something that Before I even got a service or something weird like that, I mean, I wouldn't do that either, I guess.
14:36:03 Okay. Okay, we're gonna wrap up.
14:36:08 Yeah, I think so. So.
14:36:10 Okay.
14:36:12 We are probably going to need to do a usability test for this once we've improved the platform.
14:36:19 So we're asking everyone if they'd be interested in participating in that once we're done.
14:36:25 And if you are, we would want to email you so that we can get testing. But if not, you know, no pressure, obviously.
14:36:33 Sure.
