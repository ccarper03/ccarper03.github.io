[Shelby Matthews] 11:32:15
Background.

[Charles Carper] 11:32:22
I felt with that guy when we asked him. What does his occupation? He felt.

[Charles Carper] 11:32:31
He wanted to say UX designer.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:32:34
Yeah.

[Charles Carper] 11:32:35
And I felt it from him, a carpentry, you know.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:32:38
Yep. Yeah, currently in Carpentry, yeah. Honestly, I don't wanna be stereotypical, but I wasn't expecting that.

[Charles Carper] 11:32:42
Yeah.

[Charles Carper] 11:32:47
Oh really? Okay, very nice. He does is it looks like he does like quality. Ship type of wood. Like he's, he makes that.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:32:49
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:32:57
Okay, I could see that then. That makes sense.

[Charles Carper] 11:32:59
Yeah. So it's like. Yeah. Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:33:02
That's neat.

[Charles Carper] 11:33:04
Mother Let's see if she's writing to me. Mom, are you having technical issues?

[Charles Carper] 11:33:33
Okay, yes! She says, okay, are you on your? PC or phone.

[Charles Carper] 11:33:44
I see you!

[Charles Carper] 11:33:48
TC. You wanna try and backing out and coming back in? Sometimes it's like default too, so you have to change your settings.

[Charles Carper] 11:33:59
Oh, no, she says I'm on phone.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:34:03
Hmm. Oh, the mobile app as well. To know what that looks like.

[Charles Carper] 11:34:06
Yeah, yeah. You have to check the phone, settings to make sure that they use your camera.

[Charles Carper] 11:34:14
And, and your audio.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:34:16
An audio. Yeah, just like. There's you too, I guess. Most the downside to zoom.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:34:26
It's probably gonna make her if it's not having her change her settings.

[Charles Carper] 11:34:31
She's gonna start over. Yeah, back out. Come back in.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:34:33
Yeah. Yeah.

[Charles Carper] 11:34:48
You're okay with me. Putting all these people on you because they're all people I know so I think it's better if they came from you than me.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:34:57
Yeah, it's fine. I think you're better at making it conversational, but all.

[Charles Carper] 11:34:58
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:35:03
Do my best. Yeah, it is. I do. You need the practice, so.

[Charles Carper] 11:35:04
Try and practice.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:35:12
I noticed that even. We're interviewing graphic designers like at first. It was just.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:35:18
I don't know what questions to ask. And then as more we did more, it got easier.

[Charles Carper] 11:35:24
Did it. How's it good? Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:35:25
Yeah. To like actually follow. Hello. And these are difficult question like.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:35:32
We're getting good information. I think that's what matters is that we're getting the stories we need to.

[Charles Carper] 11:35:37
Yeah

[Shelby Matthews] 11:35:37
And that's kinda what I put in big jam like as key learnings is. Even if you don't get to ask the same exact questions to everyone as long as you get their unique story out of them.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:35:47
That's what matters. Especially in a short amount of time.

[Charles Carper] 11:35:48
Yeah, right.

[Charles Carper] 11:35:51
I've been reading, on some YouTube stuff and people like talking about how How to go about doing it getting their reviews getting this stuff and then doing it so there's they're saying that you want to like Ask the question, like what is the question of overall what you're trying to solve?

[Charles Carper] 11:36:11
You know, and then from there you can make big bullet lists of big things and then you wanna ask questions around that topic.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:36:12
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:36:18
Hmm. Yeah.

[Charles Carper] 11:36:18
Right? To answer these questions. And I think that came from a better perspective than kind of what we did.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:36:25
Right. Yeah.

[Charles Carper] 11:36:26
I mean, in general, I kinda did it. We did with a chat, to give us some high level stuff we need to hit and then we kind of make some questions around that but you know.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:36:36
It's also like, I don't know, I mean, we know the business goal and everything, but I guess I do have to look like.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:36:42
I think our questions were based off the brief. And then so it's like, we don't know what we're gonna solve until we do this.

[Charles Carper] 11:36:46
Yeah. Yeah.

[Charles Carper] 11:36:50
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:36:50
You know what I mean? Like it's like how do we know what the user's problem is to sell?

[Charles Carper] 11:36:55
I see you!

[Shelby Matthews] 11:36:58
Still audio still being weird.

[Charles Carper] 11:37:00

[Shelby Matthews] 11:38:40
Right. I just don't know what it looks like. If I try to join something on my phone to see what it looks like.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:38:47

And then you had a list of doctors. Do you have to choose from? What would you do? How would you choose them?

[elaine] 11:49:27
Huh. Well. I know I'm being biased, but I would choose an older doctors because they have more experience than the young doctor that just come in and get familiar with.

[elaine] 11:52:16
Right. That's correct.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:52:17
Okay, so, so would you say that when you arrive? At the doctor's office you want to be able to give them more the information there for staffing to use the technology.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:53:34
Yeah, exactly.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:53:40
Correct. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

[Charles Carper] 11:53:42
So it's almost like, you like it the other way around would be easier, right?

[elaine] 11:53:46
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 11:53:47
So instead of the system trying to go and have access to your calendar and try to make a smart decision.

[Charles Carper] 11:53:54
Do you feel like you would better if you just saw a list of dates and times and you just selected one?

[Charles Carper] 11:53:59
On their site. So you got to decide how early or how far ahead.

[elaine] 11:54:02
Yeah. Yeah. Yep. And also, I also like, what the calendar would say.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:54:06
Gotcha. Okay. Alright.

[Charles Carper] 11:54:07
Okay.

[elaine] 11:54:13
We will, insert it in your calendar. That we give you an option like the Google Calendar or your Outlook calendar.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:54:17
Hmm. Yeah.

[elaine] 11:54:22
Give you that option to. Posted it in your personal calendars and then give us the reminder the alert of your appointment is that day.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:54:33
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 11:54:34
You like the calendar integrations. What calendar do you use?

[elaine] 11:54:36
Yes.

[elaine] 11:54:39
I use, well, if I'm on my phone, I use, the Google calendar.

[Charles Carper] 11:54:45
What other calendars you use?

[elaine] 11:54:48
Oh, whatever that's built in, on my computer or on my phone.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:54:54
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 11:54:54
Okay.

[elaine] 11:54:55
Yeah, something just pop up and there you go.

[Charles Carper] 11:54:59
Yeah

[elaine] 11:55:01
. By default

[Shelby Matthews] 11:55:03
Can you think of? Gotcha. Can you see?

[elaine] 11:55:03
Yeah, make it easier.

[Charles Carper] 11:55:06
Yeah.

[elaine] 11:55:07
You know, even though I'm sorry, but even though I am 90%, I'm also an elderly person, I'm also a an elderly person, you know, wanna make everything easy for me.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:55:10
Good.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:55:19
That's good. Yeah, that's what this is all about is making it easier. For everyone.

[elaine] 11:55:21
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:55:23
So Can you think of any scenario? Where you're going online that and you see a website.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:55:32
Is there anything about that website that would make you comfortable sharing your medical information? Or is there any kind of nothing? Okay.

[elaine] 11:55:39
No.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:55:40
And does it matter what type of medical need? Okay, okay, that's good to know. Alright.

[elaine] 11:55:43
Correct.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:55:49
So after you book your appointment. In between the time, booking that appointment online and showing up for the appointment in person.

[elaine] 11:55:51
Hmm

[Shelby Matthews] 11:56:00
Is there any additional information that you would feel like it's helpful for you to know.

[elaine] 11:56:05
Well.

[elaine] 11:56:09
It in my experience like when I first this appointment I did totally forgot.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:56:16
Okay, gotcha.

[elaine] 11:56:17
Because Is I'm not seeing it. And there's no reminder or maybe because I'm not familiar with the setup.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:56:20
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 11:56:24
Okay.

[elaine] 11:56:26
So. That kinda, yes. So I'm not familiar with so I tend to forget and which I am I'm at this age where I tend to fit because I got so many other things going on in my life that I just don't remember everything.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:56:28
Yeah, it's a new tool. Yeah.

[elaine] 11:56:41
So. Being a biased guys of my son, you know, so I kind of make an effort to remember.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:56:41
Gotcha.

[elaine] 11:56:49
This appointment. Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:56:50
Understood. I gotcha. How would you like to be? Notified like is there a specific thing that's easier for you to look at your phone.

[Charles Carper] 11:56:52
Yeah.

[elaine] 11:56:58
A lot on my phone. Yep. Yes.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:57:02
Okay. What, where add on your phone?

[Shelby Matthews] 11:57:06
Sorry, go ahead.

[elaine] 11:57:06
Yeah, yeah, just a lot like, you know, just pop up on your phone and say, hey, you got an appointment here at this time.

[elaine] 11:57:15
. Okay

[Charles Carper] 11:57:15
So, what? So because I know a little bit the background of what happened. The appointment I think gives you a notification like 30 min prior.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:57:15
Gotcha.

[elaine] 11:57:28
Yeah, I think, yeah, I think I did. It's the second time because I really pay attention to the second time, but the first time I did really.

[Charles Carper] 11:57:36
Okay. Okay. Sure. So in being that it does give you a reminder, is there something that could be more?

[elaine] 11:57:36
Because I'm not I'm not familiar with the tool.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:57:37
Thank you. Yeah.

[Charles Carper] 11:57:47
Helpful like more reminding without being in the way.

[elaine] 11:57:53
Now I notice that I'm, I mean, maybe I didn't pay attention, but I would kinda prefer that it asked me, do you want disappointment to add to your calendar.

[elaine] 11:58:06
So that way it's stop me to concentrate and say, yes, I do. Then it will.

[Charles Carper] 11:58:07
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:58:12
Hmm.

[elaine] 11:58:12
Stick it in my head. Remember that. Okay, it's in my calendar now. Danny, then later on, maybe the calendar will pop up.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:58:21
Okay. Alright.

[Charles Carper] 11:58:21
Okay, if it's on your calendar, would you think that you would be more? Susceptible upgoing.

[elaine] 11:58:29
Wet the alert.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:58:32
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 11:58:32
With alerts.

[elaine] 11:58:33
Yes, because you know I have a busy schedule. I sometime I just don't pay attention with my phone all the time.

[Charles Carper] 11:58:38
Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like if you put your phone down because you're doing yard work, you're not gonna get the notifications anyways.

[elaine] 11:58:40
Okay.

[elaine] 11:58:45
No, but it's stays on your screen.

[Charles Carper] 11:58:49
Yeah, okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:58:49
Gotcha. Days on your screen. Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:58:53
Okay, yeah, you I kinda accidentally cut you off you were trying to say you're the type of person who likes to receive the notifications from your phone.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:59:02
Would, could you elaborate a little bit on that again? Like you just are busy.

[elaine] 11:59:02
Yes.

[elaine] 11:59:06
Yeah, like. Yeah, I'm, got busy schedule, you know, and II sometimes do not look on my phone.

[elaine] 11:59:16
Sometime. But I kinda like it where it will stay on my phone. I mean, on my.

[elaine] 11:59:23
The May homepage. Oh my dad, you know, and then I can, see that.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:59:25
Okay, I see. So.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:59:31
Understood.

[elaine] 11:59:31
And that say, oh yeah, I got an appointment at certain time.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:59:34
Okay, gotcha. Cool.

[Charles Carper] 11:59:36
Being your age range you're talking about and you get a. Text message. Stand out to you more.

[elaine] 11:59:47
Yes. Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 11:59:51
Okay, cool.

[elaine] 11:59:52
Because, you know, I read my text all the time. And if I see a green dot or blue dot, they say, oh, there I got a message.

[Charles Carper] 11:59:52
Okay.

[Charles Carper] 12:00:00
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 12:00:00
Okay. Yeah. Yep. And so probably not so much email for you.

[elaine] 12:00:01
That's kind of more fun.

[Charles Carper] 12:00:04
Well, that's what we want.

[elaine] 12:00:06
Yeah.

[Shelby Matthews] 12:00:11
You're not gonna go dig through your email on your phone to get a notification.

[elaine] 12:00:13
I know, I, yeah, II have a hard time to look. The email a lot.

[Shelby Matthews] 12:00:19
Yeah.

[elaine] 12:00:19
You know, because that's how I. I say where is where is the the link and then I have to dig into my email, you know, scroll all the way down.

[Shelby Matthews] 12:00:29
Okay.

[elaine] 12:00:31
Oh, there it is, you know. So it's time to do that. But with the with the text message, Where is?

[Charles Carper] 12:00:34
Alright.

[elaine] 12:00:40
You don't get whole bunch of text with the same phone number. So at least you got at least one or 2 notes in that phone number.

[elaine] 12:00:50
And then I did just go there and then, oh, there's the link and just click it.

[Shelby Matthews] 12:00:53
Makes sense. Cool. Now is less overwhelming.

[Charles Carper] 12:00:53
Yeah.

[elaine] 12:00:54
Yeah.

[Charles Carper] 12:00:56
So you like that there's a link inside the text message too because it gets you right to where you need to go.

[elaine] 12:01:00
Yes, that is correct.

[Charles Carper] 12:01:03
Okay.

[Shelby Matthews] 12:01:03
Cool. Alright, let's get to know.

[elaine] 12:01:04
Convenient. Very convenient.

[Shelby Matthews] 12:01:07
Well, I think we kind of covered all of our questions that I can see of unless you have any additional information.

[Shelby Matthews] 12:01:15
You want to add that you might help us, unless you have any additional information you want to add that you might help us or maybe Charles has another follow-up question.

[Charles Carper] 12:01:22
So like walk me through. No, just be very general. We're just trying to book online.

[Shelby Matthews] 12:01:22
If not, I think we can wrap it up.

[Charles Carper] 12:01:29
Can you visualize how signing up for anything. Let's say a massage. What does that flow look like for you?

[Shelby Matthews] 12:01:40
Okay. No.

[Charles Carper] 12:01:43
Looks like, looks like he froze, Mom.

[Shelby Matthews] 12:01:49
I'm gonna save this.

[Shelby Matthews] 12:01:52
Just in case

[Charles Carper] 12:01:54
Sounds good
