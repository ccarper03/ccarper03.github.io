11:46:14 Okay.
11:46:11 Relevant questions to online booking. Alright, do you have a recent experience of booking a doctor's appointment online that you could tell us about?

11:46:48 Do a COVID test.
11:46:56 Okay.
11:46:49 No, well, with the COVID, yes, we have to book it online. For the COVID.
11:46:58 What was the experience like?
11:47:01 It's, okay.
11:47:04 Can you be more descriptive?
11:47:04 Do you like maybe from like.
11:47:09 Okay.

11:47:24 What?
11:47:15 Gotcha. Do you? I know it's been a while probably, you know, since you've had to deal with that, do you kind of know what the steps were that it and what, act, what information it asked from you during that process.
11:47:29 Like from start to finish.
11:47:29 Well, that's yeah, it's gonna be hard.
11:47:34 Yeah, it was a while. It's okay. If you can't remember. It's not a big deal.
11:47:39 Just anything you can is helpful.
11:47:37 Oh, I can. Well, I know that they gave us, an option on the calendar, what day and then they also give you like the times, you know, like starting from 80'clock, 90'clock, 100'clock, you know, down on the time.
11:47:55 That you prefer and II think that's it that I remember.
11:48:01 Okay, cool. So if you're gonna say you wanna book a doctor's appointment online. Do you know what might influence your decision to trying to book online if you wanted to?
11:48:15 Okay. The book, my appointment online, it depends on.
11:48:25 Okay. Alright.
11:48:23 What doctor I want. Okay, if I can't get my doctor tonight, I call in. Personally, yeah.
11:48:30 Okay. Alright, so what
11:48:34 So a very specific quality doctor is something that's important to you.
11:48:39 Yes, that is right.
11:48:41 How do you choose that doctor?
11:48:41 So, okay, so you care more about, yeah, you care more about the doctor than you do the convenience of being online.
11:48:48 That is correct. That is correct.
11:48:48 Anything like that? Go ahead, Shelby.
11:48:51 So yeah, if you, how are you choosing your doctor? Do, do you have a specific process for that?
11:48:58 The only doctor I chose is the one I go see regularly. A day. Bye.
11:49:03 Okay, so you're not you're not like trying to look at an entire list of doctors to narrow down your options.
11:49:10 Yes, the only one I'm used to to my daughter. Who knows?
11:49:13 Okay. Gotcha.
11:49:14 Well They're familiar. What if You had to choose. Like let's say your general doctor is not available.
11:49:24 And then you had a list of doctors. Do you have to choose from? What would you do? How would you choose them?
11:49:39 Okay.
11:49:27 Huh. Well. I know I'm being biased, but I would choose an older doctors because they have more experience than the young doctor that just come in and get familiar with.
11:49:48 That field.
11:49:49 Okay, that's good.
11:49:50 Okay. Is anything about their bio would stand out to you that you're like when you read it that you're like, oh yeah, I definitely like this guy or does it, is it a male or female?
11:49:59 Yeah, I Well, it doesn't matter. It's not depends on what. I'm in for like, let's say, like Pap's, I kind of prefer female.
11:50:14 Okay.
11:50:13 You know. But yes, II would read their age and their experience and their college.
11:50:22 Okay. Gotcha.
11:50:22 You know, the education.
11:50:22 Okay. Alright, okay.
11:50:26 Alright, good. Okay, so let's say you want to book a doctor's appointment online.
11:50:35 Are there any like specific features or services you wish? The platform would provide you. While trying to book.
11:50:45 Make it easier.
11:50:45 Look something. Okay. And what would do you think would make it easier for you?
11:50:50 Just right to the point. You know, like the date and time. And then give you instruction where to go like.
11:51:04 Okay.
11:51:01 On like a holding hands. For a person that is not. Save.
11:51:15 Yeah.
11:51:11 And then there's also out elderly that doesn't, that don't know anything about computers so it should be making very, very Easy for our age.
11:51:19 Okay, gotcha. So. Let's see, do you have a good follow up for that Charles?
11:51:29 So So that was the question was based on what you want and you said you would like it to be easy.
11:51:37 Yes.
11:51:38 What is easy? Mean you say step by step, but what does that what does that look like so if you went to a let's, let's, for example, you wanted to get a COVID test.
11:51:49 How would that look easy to you?
11:51:55 Give me a link. I clicked and I don't have to go step. I mean, I don't have to go through all these instructions just to get.
11:52:03 Okay. Okay. Gotcha.
11:52:06 Okay.
11:52:03 Just to get the calendar. Yeah, just go, pick me directly to the calendar and pick and then save and then.
11:52:12 That's it.
11:52:12 Hey, you don't wanna spend this a ton of time with the technology. To get your appointment booked.
11:52:16 Right. That's correct.
11:52:17 Okay, so, so would you say that when you arrive? At the doctor's office you want to be able to give them more the information there for staffing to use the technology.
11:52:29 Okay, you'd rather do that. Okay.
11:52:27 Yeah. Yeah, that is correct. Yup, that's a lot, lot of us, you know, older people.
11:52:35 We don't know details. You know, we just know.
11:52:37 So you just say. So you would you say you're comfortable sharing your medical information online during that booking process?
11:52:45 Yeah.
11:52:49 Yeah. Okay.
11:52:47 No, you want to do that all at the doctor's office? Okay. Alright. Okay, so see we can already answer that.
11:52:58 Alright. Kind of already did this too. How can how could we make it easier to find an appointment that fits your existing schedule?
11:53:12 Yeah.
11:53:09 So. So like whenever you're trying to select your dates to go to this appointment. How do you know it's not going to interfere with something on your calendar?
11:53:24 That's gonna be tough because.
11:53:34 Yeah, exactly.
11:53:28 Because that program better be very, very smart to go look into my calendar. You know, to see if I have anything on that date and time.
11:53:40 Correct. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
11:53:42 So it's almost like, you like it the other way around would be easier, right?
11:53:46 Okay.
11:53:47 So instead of the system trying to go and have access to your calendar and try to make a smart decision.
11:53:54 Do you feel like you would better if you just saw a list of dates and times and you just selected one?
11:53:59 On their site. So you got to decide how early or how far ahead.
11:54:07 Okay.
11:54:06 Gotcha. Okay. Alright.
11:54:02 Yeah. Yeah. Yep. And also, I also like, what the calendar would say.
11:54:17 Hmm. Yeah.
11:54:13 We will, insert it in your calendar. That we give you an option like the Google Calendar or your Outlook calendar.
11:54:22 Give you that option to. Posted it in your personal calendars and then give us the reminder the alert of your appointment is that day.
11:54:33 Okay.
11:54:36 Yes.
11:54:34 You like the calendar integrations. What calendar do you use?
11:54:39 I use, well, if I'm on my phone, I use, the Google calendar.
11:54:45 What other calendars you use?
11:54:48 Oh, whatever that's built in, on my computer or on my phone.
11:54:54 Okay.
11:54:54 Okay.
11:54:55 Yeah, something just pop up and there you go.
11:54:59 Yeah
11:55:01 . By default
11:55:03 Yeah, make it easier.
11:55:06 Yeah.
11:55:03 Can you think of? Gotcha. Can you see?
11:55:10 Good.
11:55:07 You know, even though I'm sorry, but even though I am 90%, I'm also an elderly person, I'm also a an elderly person, you know, wanna make everything easy for me.
11:55:19 That's good. Yeah, that's what this is all about is making it easier. For everyone.
11:55:21 Okay.
11:55:23 So Can you think of any scenario? Where you're going online that and you see a website.
11:55:32 Is there anything about that website that would make you comfortable sharing your medical information? Or is there any kind of nothing? Okay.
11:55:39 No.
11:55:43 Correct.
11:55:40 And does it matter what type of medical need? Okay, okay, that's good to know. Alright.
11:55:49 So after you book your appointment. In between the time, booking that appointment online and showing up for the appointment in person.
11:56:00 Is there any additional information that you would feel like it's helpful for you to know.
11:56:05 Well.
11:56:09 It in my experience like when I first this appointment I did totally forgot.
11:56:16 Okay, gotcha.
11:56:20 Okay.
11:56:17 Because Is I'm not seeing it. And there's no reminder or maybe because I'm not familiar with the setup.
11:56:24 Okay.
11:56:28 Yeah, it's a new tool. Yeah.
11:56:26 So. That kinda, yes. So I'm not familiar with so I tend to forget and which I am I'm at this age where I tend to fit because I got so many other things going on in my life that I just don't remember everything.
11:56:41 Gotcha.
11:56:41 So. Being a biased guys of my son, you know, so I kind of make an effort to remember.
11:56:49 This appointment. Yeah.
11:56:52 Yeah.
11:56:50 Understood. I gotcha. How would you like to be? Notified like is there a specific thing that's easier for you to look at your phone.
11:57:02 Okay. What, where add on your phone?
11:56:58 A lot on my phone. Yep. Yes.
11:57:06 Sorry, go ahead.
11:57:06 Yeah, yeah, just a lot like, you know, just pop up on your phone and say, hey, you got an appointment here at this time.
11:57:15 Gotcha.
11:57:15 . Okay
11:57:15 So, what? So because I know a little bit the background of what happened. The appointment I think gives you a notification like 30 min prior.
11:57:28 Yeah, I think, yeah, I think I did. It's the second time because I really pay attention to the second time, but the first time I did really.
11:57:36 Because I'm not I'm not familiar with the tool.
11:57:37 Thank you. Yeah.
11:57:36 Okay. Okay. Sure. So in being that it does give you a reminder, is there something that could be more?
11:57:47 Helpful like more reminding without being in the way.
11:57:53 Now I notice that I'm, I mean, maybe I didn't pay attention, but I would kinda prefer that it asked me, do you want disappointment to add to your calendar.
11:58:07 Okay.
11:58:06 So that way it's stop me to concentrate and say, yes, I do. Then it will.
11:58:12 Hmm.
11:58:12 Stick it in my head. Remember that. Okay, it's in my calendar now. Danny, then later on, maybe the calendar will pop up.
11:58:21 Okay. Alright.
11:58:21 Okay, if it's on your calendar, would you think that you would be more? Susceptible upgoing.
11:58:29 Wet the alert.
11:58:32 With alerts.
11:58:32 Okay.
11:58:33 Yes, because you know I have a busy schedule. I sometime I just don't pay attention with my phone all the time.
11:58:40 Okay.
11:58:38 Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like if you put your phone down because you're doing yard work, you're not gonna get the notifications anyways.
11:58:45 No, but it's stays on your screen.
11:58:49 Yeah, okay.
11:58:49 Gotcha. Days on your screen. Okay.
11:58:53 Okay, yeah, you I kinda accidentally cut you off you were trying to say you're the type of person who likes to receive the notifications from your phone.
11:59:02 Yes.
11:59:02 Would, could you elaborate a little bit on that again? Like you just are busy.
11:59:06 Yeah, like. Yeah, I'm, got busy schedule, you know, and II sometimes do not look on my phone.
11:59:16 Sometime. But I kinda like it where it will stay on my phone. I mean, on my.
11:59:25 Okay, I see. So.
11:59:23 The May homepage. Oh my dad, you know, and then I can, see that.
11:59:31 Understood.
11:59:31 And that say, oh yeah, I got an appointment at certain time.
11:59:34 Okay, gotcha. Cool.
11:59:36 Being your age range you're talking about and you get a. Text message. Stand out to you more.
11:59:47 Yes. Yeah.
11:59:51 Okay, cool.
11:59:52 Okay.
11:59:52 Because, you know, I read my text all the time. And if I see a green dot or blue dot, they say, oh, there I got a message.
12:00:00 Yeah.
12:00:01 That's kind of more fun.
12:00:04 Well, that's what we want.
12:00:06 Yeah.
12:00:00 Okay. Yeah. Yep. And so probably not so much email for you.
12:00:11 You're not gonna go dig through your email on your phone to get a notification.
12:00:13 I know, I, yeah, II have a hard time to look. The email a lot.
12:00:19 Yeah.
12:00:19 You know, because that's how I. I say where is where is the the link and then I have to dig into my email, you know, scroll all the way down.
12:00:29 Okay.
12:00:34 Alright.
12:00:31 Oh, there it is, you know. So it's time to do that. But with the with the text message, Where is?
12:00:40 You don't get whole bunch of text with the same phone number. So at least you got at least one or 2 notes in that phone number.
12:00:50 And then I did just go there and then, oh, there's the link and just click it.
12:00:53 Yeah.
12:00:54 Yeah.
12:00:53 Makes sense. Cool. Now is less overwhelming.
12:00:56 So you like that there's a link inside the text message too because it gets you right to where you need to go.
12:01:00 Yes, that is correct.
12:01:03 Cool. Alright, let's get to know.
12:01:03 Okay.
12:01:04 Convenient. Very convenient.
12:01:07 Well, I think we kind of covered all of our questions that I can see of unless you have any additional information.
12:01:15 You want to add that you might help us, unless you have any additional information you want to add that you might help us or maybe Charles has another follow-up question.
12:01:22 If not, I think we can wrap it up.
12:01:22 So like walk me through. No, just be very general. We're just trying to book online.
12:01:29 Can you visualize how signing up for anything. Let's say a massage. What does that flow look like for you?
12:01:40 Okay. No.
12:01:43 Looks like, looks like he froze, Mom.
12:01:49 I'm gonna save this.
12:01:52 Just in case.
12:01:54 Sounds good.
12:01:56 Okay.
12:02:00 Let me, messenger her on messenger.
12:02:09 Yeah.
12:02:05 Alright. Well, at least that was good timing to, because we were only had like a few follow ups.
12:02:13 Okay.
12:02:22 Oh, she's on. Alright. That's okay. Is this the recording video?
